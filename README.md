# Breakout

Hello visitor! 
Assignment 2 is divided into 3 sub tasks, so I've shared the screenshots of the final game which perfectly addresses those subtasks.

<b>1. Spawns a powerup balls</b><br>
Here, this yellow item falls downwards and when collided with paddle, spawns 3 balls as seen in the next picture.<br>

<img src="1_balls_2.png" width = "600">
<br>
Note : Here, in the previous two images you can see that as the player gathers more scores, the paddle size increases.
<br>

<b>2. Grow and shrink the Paddle</b><br>
Here, in the next two images you can see that as the player looses health point, the paddle size decreases.

<b>3. Add a locked Brick</b><br>
Here, in the next two images you see locked brick and key Powerup respectively.
